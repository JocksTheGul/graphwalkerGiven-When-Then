# graphwalker_Given-When-Then
An extension to the MBT tool Graphwalker, created for a thesis in MDH Sweden

How to apply and run extension:
1. Download source code for Graphwalker, https://github.com/GraphWalker/graphwalker-project
2. In \graphwalker-project\graphwalker-studio\src\main\js\components\configpanel add text-group.js as a new file
3. In \graphwalker-project\graphwalker-studio\src\main\js\components\configpanel\index.js add <TextGroup\> in between the <PanelContent> brackets
4. See how to run Graphwalker via link above
5. Add new model
6. Open properties window (located at the lowest button in the left side-menu)
7. Go the furthest down and either upload a JSON file with the set format or write in text boxes.
8. Click Add Element button

Note: f12 for debugging
```bash
test.json contains a JSON file that has the set format. Can also be used in the extension.
```
